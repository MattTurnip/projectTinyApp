# Welcome to the TinyApp URL shortener!


TinyApp is a fullstack url shortening webapp built with Node and Express!
Althought this app will probably not revolutionize the way you consume internet, it sure is handy.
After using TinyUrl, your URL experience will go from looking like an unmanageable, too-much-to-eat **12-foot-long 𝔭𝔞𝔯𝔱𝔶 𝔰𝔲𝔟**, to a much more manageable, consumable and edible **_6-inch 𝓋𝑒𝑔𝑔𝒾𝑒 𝓈𝓊𝒷_**. 

Dependencies:
* node Js
* express
* bcrypt for password hashing
* cookie session for cookie encrypting
* body parser to get req-bodys!
* ejs templating

To run TinyApp:

* clone this repo into a new folder
* install the dependencies using `npm install`
* run the webserve using command node `express_server.js`
* use your favourite browser to poke around http://local:8080/
* enjoy

##### A common conundrum among internet users:

* ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ at first you're like "what do I do with this URL?"
* go to _TinyUrl_ , register and flip your URL into the form (╯°□°）╯ ︵ ˥ɹ∩
* ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ  ᵘʳˡ your URL is now tiny-fied just for you!



**Bye bye for now!**

# Welcome to the TinyUrl app!

This app will probably revolutionize the way you consume internet content.
After using TinyUrl, the internet will go from looking like an unmanageable,
too-much-to-eat **12-foot-long 𝔭𝔞𝔯𝔱𝔶 𝔰𝔲𝔟**, to a much more manageable, consumable
and edible **_6-inch 𝓋𝑒𝑔𝑔𝒾𝑒 𝓈𝓊𝒷_**.

---

##### Here's how it works!:

* ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ at first you're like "what do I do with this URL?"
* go to _TinyUrl_ and flip your URL into the form (╯°□°）╯ ︵ ˥ɹ∩
* ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ  ᵘʳˡ your URL is now tiny-fied!

_how you'll feel looking at long URLS from now on_

**Bye bye for now!**
